<h1><font size="40">Instructions</font></h1>

This website is based on the docusaurus framework, that uses Markdown with JavaScript (JSX). The most important and used components are explained below. More information about Markdown in docusaurus can be found [here.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features)

## Editing
For changing the documentation you need a GitHUb Account and then you can use the ```Edit this page``` Button at the left bottom of every page. This will leads you to an Editor on GitHub, where you can directly edit the page and make a Pull Request afterwards.  
For advanced usage of chemotion_saurus, you can also clone the repository and push to it, if you have write access. Therefore follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus#readme).  
You can check [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/actions), to see if your changes are succesfully merged in the master branch.

## New Page
- use .mdx as filename ending in GitHub
- After you have inserted a new page, add it to the [TOC (table of contents)](#toc) so that it will be visible on the page.
- Insert at the top of every page:

``` 
---
id: videos_eln
sidebar_label: Videos
slug: videos_eln
title: Introduction Videos
---
```

`id:`  The unique document id. By default, a document id is the name of the document (without the extension) relative to the root docs directory. It can be used in the left TOC.  
`sidebar_label:` Name displayed in the table of content (TOC).  
`slug:` Optional. Defines the last part of the URL.  
`title:`  Optional. Prompted on the page.

## Markdown

### Buttons
#### regular buttons with text and icon content
For creating buttons use a button function and import it in the page. Every button gets a **color** and can have multiple text elements and icons **mixed** in its content.  
For icon buttons the library Font Awesome is used. Get icons from here: [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/) and import them in the page, too. The color palette is from the [Infima library](https://infima.dev/docs/components/button).  
For example following code snippet...
```
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'
import { faChartBar, faCheck } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons' 
import {Btn} from '@site/docs/btn.js'

<Btn mixed={[faChartBar, " 1", faCheck]} color={"secondary"}/>
```
...produces <Btn mixed={[faChartBar, " 1", faCheck]} color={"warning"}/>

#### special buttons
To create a button diffrent from the regular one, e. g. with a different size, you need to use a React button with `<button></button>` tags.   
You can change the size of a button in its style attribute with values in `%`, pixel (`px`), `rem` or `em`. Common icon sizes inside buttons are `xs`, `sm` and `lg`.
```
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'
import { faPlus, faShareAlt } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'

<button className={"button button--sm button--success"} style={{padding:"2px", height: "50%", width: "50%"}}>
<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg"/>
</button>

<button className={"button button--sm button--success"} style={{padding:"2px", height: "40px", width: "40px"}}>
<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="sm"/>
</button>
```
<button className={"button button--sm button--success"} style={{padding:"2px", height: "50%", width: "50%"}}>
<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg"/> long text
</button>

<button className={"button button--sm button--success"} style={{padding:"2px", height: "40px", width: "40px"}}>
<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="sm"/> tall
</button>

### Downloadable Files
If you want to provide one or multiple file(s) to download directly form the manual, then upload them to the files folder in [GitHub](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/upload/master/static/files) and insert a Downlaod Button with the filepath(s) - separated by comma - in `files` and the button text in `text` :  
``` 
import { DownloadBtn } from '@site/docs/download_files.js'

<p><DownloadBtn files={['/chemotionsaurus/files/template%20_sample_import.xlsx, docker-compose.yml']}  text={"Download XLSX Template here "}/></p>
``` 
### Headings
To create a heading, add number signs # in front of a word or phrase. The number of # you use should correspond to the heading level. A lot of # indicates a low level.

### Images
Images can be inserted as Markdown or as HTML for special configurations (resizing etc.) or if the image is inside an HTML tag:
``` 
![Management Level Button](/img/mgmt_level_btn.png)  
<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/mgmt_level_btn.png"} width={"20px"} alt={"Management Level Button"}/>
``` 
There should be no /static in src.

### Info Boxes
Highlighted info boxes ([like in the eln intro page](./docs/eln/intro)) with further informations are called "Admonitions" in docusaurus. [See here.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions)

### Line Breaks
Insert **two white spaces** at the end of the line.

### Links
```
[alt tag](link)
```

#### extern
```
[www.chemotion.net](http://www.chemotion.net)
```

#### intern
link to another page in the docu with the ```slug``` or if not available the ```id``` as anchor:
```
[contact](specific_contact)
```
link to another chapter in the same page with the last segement of the URL:  
e. g. URL: eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/instructions <b>#toc</b>  
```
[link to TOC](#toc)
```

## TOC
The TOC on the left of every documentation page must be manually updated via [**sidebarsELN.js**](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/edit/master/sidebarsELN.js) or [**sidebarsREPO.js**](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/edit/master/sidebarsREPO.js) on GitHub. If you have inserted a new page or want to change the order, change it here.

## Versioning
Currently versioning is enabled for the ELN part of the documentation. This includes major and minor releases, but not bug fixes. To create a new documentation version based on the latest content in the ```docs/eln``` directory follow these steps:  
1. Pull the GitHub repo of chemotion_saurus locally. This is necessary, because a lot of files and folders through npm will be added.  
1. In ```docusaurus.config.js```: Change the ```current``` version to the new version and add the former current version to the other versions below.
1. in ```sidebarsELN.js```: Add the new version to the ```Versions``` category.
1. After the first three steps, you can create a new version with ```npm run docusaurus docs:version:elnID <former version number>```, e. g. ```npm run docusaurus docs:version:elnID 0.9``` The version number should be the **last** version, but not the latest/current. The latest version will be stored in ```docs/eln``` folder and should be the version, that is currently under construction. The ```npm run docusaurus docs:version ...``` creates a new folder with the version number, that should not be edited anymore. Nevertheless it is possible to edit it.   
For example: you are planning a new version 0.10, that is already the current version of the code. Then you probably have a version 0.8 and a current version with the label 0.9 (but not with a versioned folder 0.9) in docusaurus. Now you create a version 0.9 through the npm command. Your current version gets 0.10 and is stored in ```docs/eln``` and you will have one more versioned folders: 0.9 and 0.8.  
If you want to version the repository part of the documenation, then add the ```lastVersion``` and ```versions``` keys to the ```"@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs"``` plugin with the ```id: "repoID"``` in ```docusaurus.config.js``` and follow the steps above.
