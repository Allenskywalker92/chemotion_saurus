## Collections: Organization, Function and Usage
### Collection Bar
The collection bar is used to organize the ELN. Some symbols are defined below:

| symbol | meaning |
|---|---|
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faList} size="lg"/>  |  Toggle Collections on/of  |
| <Btn icon={faCog} color={"danger"}/> | switch between Collection and Element View |
| <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/> | open subcollections |
| <Btn icon={faMinus} color={"success"}/> | close subcollections |
| <Btn icon={faShareAlt} color={"secondary"}/> | Your own collections are listed in the collection bar. Collections that you have shared with other researchers (**My shared collections**) or that have been shared with you (**Shared with me**) are also listed. Collections can also be created that are permanently accessible by several users (**Synchronized collections**). |

### Standard Collections All and chemotion.net
Every user will find the two pre-installed collections **All** and **chemotion.net** in their ELN. These are not meant to be removed as they represent an important functionality.

#### `All`: The All collection
In the **All** collection, all elements from the other collections and subcollections are gathered. The **All** collection provides access to all other collections. It is very important if the assignment of an element is accidentally deleted (e.g. **remove**). The collection **All** has been created as a security collection so that an element would still be available and able to be re-assigned if it is no longer associated with a certain collection (this should not actually happen).

:::danger Caution
No action can be performed within the All collection because it is a kind of backup. Please change to your work collections to edit your samples or experiments.
