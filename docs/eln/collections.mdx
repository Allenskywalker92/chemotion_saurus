## Collections: Organization, Function and Usage
### Collection Bar
The collection bar is used to organize the ELN. Some symbols are defined below:

| symbol | meaning |
|---|---|
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faList} size="lg"/>  |  Toggle Collections on/of  |
| <Btn icon={faCog} color={"danger"}/> | switch between Collection and Element View |
| <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/> | open subcollections |
| <Btn icon={faMinus} color={"success"}/> | close subcollections |
| <Btn icon={faShareAlt} color={"secondary"}/> | Your own collections are listed in the collection bar. Collections that you have shared with other researchers (**My shared collections**) or that have been shared with you (**Shared with me**) are also listed. Collections can also be created that are permanently accessible by several users (**Synchronized collections**). |

### Standard Collections All and chemotion.net
Every user will find the two pre-installed collections **All** and **chemotion.net** in their ELN. These are not meant to be removed as they represent an important functionality.

#### `All`: The All collection
In the **All** collection, all elements from the other collections and subcollections are gathered. The **All** collection provides access to all other collections. It is very important if the assignment of an element is accidentally deleted (e.g. **remove**). The collection **All** has been created as a security collection so that an element would still be available and able to be re-assigned if it is no longer associated with a certain collection (this should not actually happen).

:::danger Caution
No action can be performed within the All collection because it is a kind of backup. Please change to your work collections to edit your samples or experiments.

#### `chemotion.net`: The chemotion.net collection
The **chemotion.net** collection enables sorting elements for publishing within Chemotion repository. 

The Collection is pre-installed to make every user aware of the possibility of easily providing their data. The repository can be used to store the data at any time, and these data can be useful to other scientists later on. 

The **chemotion.net** collection should be used when the ELN user wants to make data on samples, reactions or results available to other researchers. Initially, the collection is just a folder that is used for structuring within one's own journal. There is no access to these data from outside. If the journal user is ready to provide their information, then they can share the data from within the **chemotion.net** collection by re-selecting and confirming their release to the repository. If this release is made within the term of a competition (periods are regularly announced on www.chemotion.net), the entries will be registered for the competition.

###  Sorting and Organizing
![Collection View](/img/first_collection.gif)

Creating, sorting, and organizing collections are carried out in collection management (accessible via the collection button <Btn icon={faCog} color={"danger"}/> in the collection bar). A new collection can be generated through collection management. By pressing <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/>, a new entry **New Collection** is created under **My Collections**. Give your collection a name and save it by pressing **update** <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Update</button>.

:::danger Caution
Without the creation of collections, the use of the ELN is not possible! Remember to **update** <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Update</button>! Without this confirmation, no collection will be generated
:::

Think about a meaningful structuring and create your collections accordingly. You can create as many collections as you want, but the overview of your journal should be in the foreground. As a rule, it makes sense to initially have a collection as your electronic journal, and possibly a second collection e.g. to reproduce your chemical database. Another way to structure your ELN is to create sub-collections. Each collection can be organized by creating subcollections which, in turn, can include subcollections.  This allows you to create a folder system that is very similar to Windows folder system. Please note:  Subcollections  are suitable for structuring, but the contents of a  subcollection  are not available to the collection. This fact must be taken into account in particular when carrying out actions such as **Sharing**. 

The creation of a subcollection is done in the same way as the creation of a collection. The collection obtains the function assignment as a subfolder within collection management by manually indenting the folder to the  right. Drag & Drop can turn the collection into a subcollection. Again, this change will not take effect until the action is confirmed by **update** <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Update</button>.   

:::caution Recommendation 
Each collection can be organized by creating subcollections. These, in turn, can include subcollections. Subcollections are not mirrored in the upper collection, they are rather just an optical structuring tool. 
::: 

Sorting and organizing your collections and subcollections is always feasible. The function assignment as collection or subcollection can also be changed at any time via collection management. In  addition to the ability to organize your own created collections through **My Collections**, collection management also enables you to sort your own collections that have been shared with other people. This can  be done within the **My  shared  Collections** tab. The meaning of this function will become clear in the  page Sharing. Organizing  synchronized collections through collection management is not possible because they directly represent the original collections. This is explained in more detail in chapter
