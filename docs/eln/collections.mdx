## Collections: Organization, Function and Usage
### Collection Bar
The collection bar is used to organize the ELN. Some symbols are defined below:

| symbol | meaning |
|---|---|
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faList} size="lg"/>  |  Toggle Collections on/of  |
| <button className="button button--sm  button--danger" ><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCog} size="lg"/></button> | switch between Collection and Element View |
| <button className="button button--sm  button--success" ><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg"/></button> | open subcollections |
| <button className="button button--sm  button--success" ><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faMinus} size="lg"/></button> | close subcollections |
| <button className="button button--sm  button--secondary" ><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faShareAlt} size="lg"/></button> | Your own collections are listed in the collection bar. Collections that you have shared with other researchers (**My shared collections**) or that have been shared with you (**Shared with me**) are also listed. Collections can also be created that are permanently accessible by several users (**Synchronized collections**). |

### Standard Collections All and chemotion.net
Every user will find the two pre-installed collections **All** and **chemotion.net** in their ELN. These are not meant to be removed as they represent an important functionality.
