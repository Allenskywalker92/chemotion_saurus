The  details modal or details window is opened by clicking on the desired element from element lists. It shows the information stored or available through databases about the element. The modal/window  can be set to full screen mode. Its frame is identified by two colors: a dark blue and a light blue. The color light blue means that changes have been made within the modal, but they have not been saved yet. If this is the case, a small save symbol also appears in the modal bar <Btn icon={faSave} color={"warning"}/>. As soon as you have saved all the entered data, the frame color changes to dark blue and the symbol disappears.

Tabs were introduced to organize the information within the details modals. They enable information structuring and displaying as in folders. Different tabs are available based on the type of the element. This will become clear in the later chapters. 

## Details modal for samples 
![Details modal](/img/details_modal_samp.png)
Once you have entered and saved the structure of the sample, some additional information will be provided automatically. This applies to all information that can be generated by Open Babel based on the structure of your sample  (chemical formula, molecular weight). Likewise, the name of your molecule and its exact mass are created automatically, as far as the molecule is known via the PubChem database and this information is available, along with symbols of chemical safety. More details about chemical safety is provided as a link to PubChem too. 

### Properties tab
![Sample properties](/img/sample_properties.png)
The first tab that allows the description of samples is the **Properties** tab.  In the **Molecule** field, the user can pick the preferred naming convention for their molecule or write a new one. They could also specify the absolute and the relative configuration of the molecule in the fields **Stereo Abs**, **Stereo Rel** respectively from drop-downs. The user can mark their confidential data as **Top secret**.  

If you want to assign a name (e.g. a trivial name) to a sample, you can do this by making an entry in the **Name** or **Description** fields. Please note that the **Name** field for samples from reactions is overwritten by additional information. Your created sample will have the selected name, but when a new sample is created by dragging and dropping it into a reaction scheme, the Name field will be overwritten. If you want to save a second or more names for your sample permanently, use the **Description** field. 

:::danger Caution 
The **Name** field within the Sample **Properties** tab is overwritten for samples that represent products in  a reaction, because the product **Name** is required.  
::: 

In addition to the naming options, an external label can be saved for each sample. This external label should be used to enable your sample to be assigned to another storage system. For example, if you make a sample available for a reference database or send it to a cooperation partner who renames your sample, your sample will receive a sequential number that is not determined by you. Enter this number in the **External label** field. For participants in the [Compound Platform](https://www.complat.kit.edu/), the **External label** field is reserved for the X-Vial numbers of the samples. 

Solvent can be specified from a predefined drop-down. The amount can be provided either as mass or in mols, where providing one of them leads to automatic calculation of the other based on the purity (1 by default but can be modified). Mass unit can be either g or mg, while amount unit is either mol or mmol. Volume data can’t be edited until the density is specified.  When the density is specified (g/ml), the volume is automatically calculated. Changing the volume manually leads to automatic changes in the mass. 

Both** Boiling point** and **Melting point** can be provided manually in Celsius **°C**. The user can additionally provide any desired information as free text in the **Description** field and specify the location of the samples (e.g. institute, warehouse, etc.) in the **Location**  field. 

The **Elemental composition** is automatically calculated based on the formula, but the user can still provide their experimental numbers in fields that correspond to each atom in the molecule. 

The information required for chemical use is supplemented by **Chemical identifiers** such as **InChI** , **Canonical SMILLES** and **CAS** number. Molecular structure is also provided in the **Molfile** format.  You can provide the **Canonical SMILLES** to create a new **Sample**, but you can’t modify the SMILES after creation. The other identifiers can only be copied after a **Sample** is created, and they can’t be used to generate Samples. 

### Analyses tab 
![Analyses](/img/analyses_tab.gif)

To add analytics information to the ELN, the **Analyses** tab is available. Here the evaluation of the performed analytical experiments can be entered  (field **Content**) and additional files can be uploaded to store the data and its documents  (see  datasets).  

You can create as many analyses for a sample as you need with the button <button className={"button button--sm button--success"} style={{padding:"0.5rem"}}><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg"/> Add analysis</button>, and for each analysis you can upload as many datasets (files) as you want with the button <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/>. Please pay attention to the structure of the data storage and take care of the input fields, this will allow you to search your results quickly. Any information that you define through the created fields is available to the ELN for processing and this data can be displayed or summarized in lists.  

The uploaded records can be supplemented with information in an input modal available for each data file. The input modal opens either when you create a new data record, or when you click on the link generated by the name of existing data records. 

Analyses that you have entered are shown in short form e.g. in the sample list, and you can find out at a glance which data you have entered. The illustration shows the sample list with symbols such as <button className={"button button--sm button--secondary"} style={{padding:"0.5rem"}}><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faChartBar} size="lg"/> 1 ?</button> or <button className={"button button--sm button--secondary"} style={{padding:"0.5rem"}}><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faChartBar} size="lg"/> 1 <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCheck} size="sm"/></button>. The first case means that you have set an analysis for the analyzed sample, but its **Status** is so far **Unconfirmed**. The second symbol informs you again about an existing analysis whose **Status** has already been **Confirmed**, and therefore, it is classified by you as correct. The number given always refers to the number of analyses, not to the number of uploaded data files.

The analysis methods, from which you can choose, are given by the drop-down menu **Type (Chemical Methods Ontology)**. You shouldn't forget one important property of the ELN: the uploaded data files and entered information are not saved until you confirm that with <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Save</button> or <Btn icon={faSave} color={"warning"}/>. This point if overlooked can lead to the loss of the data you have set. 

### Literature tab 
![Literature](/img/literature_tab.gif)

The **Literature** tab allows you to manage your literature and link it to your **Sample**. You can specify as many references as you find needed. It is possible to specify the reference either by its DOI or ISBN, or by giving it a title and a URL. In both cases, you can add whether this reference is citing you or cited by you. When all details of a reference are entered, press <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/>. Once a reference is created, it cannot be edited, it can only be deleted, so if you need to edit a reference, delete it and create a new one.  

The created references are added to a list and they are shown in blue to indicate their functionality in linking to some resources by clicking on them. Each reference can by copied using <Btn icon={faPaste} color={"secondary"}/>, which will copy the information provided in the list. Additional details about the reference, as by whom it was created and whether it is referring to or cited by you,  can be shown by pressing the button <Btn icon={faAngleRight} color={"secondary"}/>, which also shows the delete button <Btn icon={faTrashAlt} color={"danger"}/>. Don’t forget to save your changes with <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Save</button>. 

### SciFinder tab 
Not available at the moment.

### Results tab 
This tab is not supported at the moment as it is still being developed.

### QC & curation tab 

## Details modal for reactions 
### Scheme tab 
The **Scheme** tab initially contains the scheme of the selected reaction. While the molecular structure of samples can be edited by selecting the structure field and opening the **Ketcher** editor, the reaction **Scheme** cannot be changed. If the user wants to change their reaction, they have to select the contained samples and change their structure or select other samples. 

:::info  
Changing a reaction is not possible by changing its scheme, rather it must be carried out indirectly by selecting or changing the samples. 
::: 

The following figure shows a typical reaction scheme with a reagent table. No solvents have yet been added and no reaction temperature has yet been set. In general, you cannot edit gray fields in the reaction table.  
![Reagents_table](/img/reaction_details_modal.png)
The used  samples are divided into **Starting materials**, **Reactants** and **Products**. The samples can be moved flexibly from one category to another with drag & drop symbol <Btn icon={faArrowsAlt} color={"secondary"}/>. This grouping causes functional differences: The difference between the **Starting materials** and the**Reactants** lies in the way their corresponding samples are treated upon generation. This will become clear later on in this chapter when discussing adding samples to a reaction. Regarding the **Products**, their fields can only be modified to a limited extent to avoid misuse of the journal. Certain fields that can be obtained from the received quantity of the product are not open for input. The **Products** have a special treatment within the reaction, for example the analyses of the corresponding samples are stored and can be found in the **Analyses** tab. 

A reaction can be populated with samples in two different ways: 
1. `Create new sample `: The user can create new samples by pressing <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/>  in the corresponding category **Starting materials**, **Reactants** or **Products**.  In this case, the **Starting materials** samples will be added to the samples list. The **Reactants** will be saved as samples, and they are initially displayed in the samples list, but when you save the reaction, all **Reactants** are not displayed in the list anymore in order to avoid unnecessary accumulation of samples, which are very often used as reactants. The **Reactants**  samples are still accessible from within the reaction **Scheme** by pressing the reactant name. 

:::caution Recommendation 
If you want to see a reactant displayed in the samples list, change its status from Reactants to Starting materials. By definition, Reactants are not displayed in the samples list. 
::: 

2. `Select samples from the samples list `: The user can select samples from the samples list if they are already there and drag and drop them using either one of the <Btn icon={faArrowsAlt} color={"secondary"}/> symbols next to its molecular structure or next to the sample name and place the sample in the reaction. If you only want to adopt the molecular structure, then the <Btn icon={faArrowsAlt} color={"secondary"}/> symbol next to the molecular structure in the sample list must be used for the drag & drop action. The internal process here corresponds to the **copy** action. If you want to carry out a reaction that uses existing samples, e.g. carry out a subsequent reaction and use a product from a previous reaction as starting material or use a chemical from a chemical container, then you should use the symbol <Btn icon={faArrowsAlt} color={"secondary"}/> next to a sample name in the sample list and place the sample in the reaction using drag & drop. A **split** of the sample is generated internally in the system (recognizable by the generation of the sample number). This applies only to the **Starting materials** as dragging and dropping of samples to the **Reactants** section doesn‘t add anything to the samples list. Splitting is not possible for products, as they always have to be recreated, but **copy** is possible. 
The user can choose either the **Starting materials** or the**Reactants** as a reference using the **Ref** switch. As a result, the selected reference is automatically assigned an equivalent **Equiv** of 1.000. Several **Starting materials** and **Reactants** can be added, but only one sample can be marked as reference material.        

Mass can be represented in g, mg or μg, the volume in l, ml, μl, and the amount in mol or mmol. Entering the one type of data leads to automatic calculation of the other. The volume is calculated only if the molarity of the sample is already set, and the equivalents are calculated unless the sample is a reference, then it gets a fixed equivalent of 1.000. By entering the mass, volume or amount of the reference, the remaining information for the further samples is calculated as soon as at least either the **amount** or the **Equiv** is given for them. 

:::info  
When entering the amount of your sample, you can decide which unit you want to use by pressing the unit button next to the number. 
::: 
:::danger Caution
The calculation and display of the volume can only be correct if the molarity of the sample has been entered correctly and precisely in the sample. 
::: 

An additional function is included within the reaction table, which allows you to differentiate between reaction planning and implementation. You can find the function under the title **T/R**.  <button className="button button--sm button--success">t</button>  means that you can enter/ calculate inputs according to the reaction planning. If you switch from <button className="button button--sm button--success">t</button>  to <button className="button button--sm button--primary">r</button>, you can enter the quantities actually received. This function was created so that in the event of a deviation (e.g. due to accuracy in the dosage) from the planned experiments, the values of both procedures are still available. 

The solvents can be introduced by expanding the gray area **Solvents**. The user can either pick a solvent from the drop-down **Default solvents**,  or they can use a sample as a solvent, and in this case the sample will be treated the same way as a reactant sample, i.e. it can be created with <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/>, but it will not be displayed in the samples list, or if the sample is already in the samples list, it can be dragged and dropped with <Btn icon={faArrowsAlt} color={"secondary"}/>, but no **copy** or **split** will occur here.  

The solvent can be given a **Label** which is transferred to the reaction arrow when updated by the symbol <Btn icon={faSyncAlt} color={"secondary"}/>. When specifying the solvents volumes **Vol** (in l, ml, or μl), the molarity of the solution **Conc** is automatically calculated based on the individual samples in the reaction table. You can add as many solvents as you want. If you are using more than one solvent, the volume ratio **Vol ratio** of the solvents to each other is displayed. You can also distinguish between solvent details in the planned and implemented reaction with <button className="button button--sm button--success">t</button> (planned) and <button className="button button--sm button--primary">r</button> (implemented). Samples and solvents in a reaction can be removed from the reaction using the button <Btn icon={faTrashAlt} color={"danger"}/>. 

In the gray area **Conditions**, the user can give their reaction a **Name**, and describe it with a **Status** from a drop-down. The **Status** is reflected in the list of reactions by a symbol, so you can see at a glance your evaluation of the reactions. The following table shows all the possible **Status** and the corresponding symbols. 

| symbol | Status| 

|---|---| 

| <Btn icon={faClock} color={"warning"}/>  |  Planned | 

| <Btn icon={faHourglassHalf} color={"warning"}/> | Running | 

| <Btn icon={faHourglassEnd} color={"primary"}/> | Done | 

| <Btn icon={faEllipsisH} color={"primary"}/> | Analyses Pending | 

| <Btn icon={faCheckCircle} color={"success"}/> | Successful | 

| <Btn icon={faTimesCircle} color={"success"}/> | Not Successful | 

The temperature of a reaction is inserted via the **Temperature** field. If a **Temperature** has been defined, it is also displayed on the reaction arrow. When entering the temperature, you can choose between the Kelvin **K**, Celsius **°C** and Fahrenheit **°F** scale. Enter the temperature in the given scale and switch to the desired unit. You can also enter a complex temperature profile by selecting the graph symbol for the temperature field <Btn icon={faChartArea} color={"secondary"}/>. A window opens that allows you to enter temperature changes with time, and it displays those changes in a chart. Use + to add a temperature change and – to remove it.  

The user can specify the **Duration** of the reaction by adding its **Start** time and **Stop** time with the following format: DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss or DD.MM.YYYY hh:mm:ss, then the **Duration** is automatically calculated. The user can also input current time with the <Btn icon={faClock} color={"secondary"}/> button. The calculated **Duration** can be copied with <Btn icon={faPaste} color={"secondary"}/>, or rounded to the next field either in **Week(s)**, **Day(s)**, **Hour(s)**, **Minute(s)**, or **Second(s)**. 

you can also choose the **Type** of your reactions from the **Name Reaction Ontology** drop-down.  And you can assign a **Role** to the reaction, such as a **General Procedure**, **Parts of GB**, and **Single**. The **Description** field is intended for recording your reaction implementation. Please give a detailed description of how you carried out the reaction. The **Description** field is mirrored within the second **Properties** tab (and vice versa) to give the user the freedom in which tab they would like to maintain the description of the reaction. The same applies to the **Name**  and **Temperature** fields. 

For a quick overview of the **Purification** methods that you have used to isolate your target compound,  a drop-down menu has been introduced in which you can list the purification methods used. The methods Flash-Chromatography, TLC, HPLC, Extraction, Distillation, Sublimation and Crystallization are available. The selected methods are lined up as a list. **Purification Solvents** can be added, and they are treated exactly the same way as the reaction **Solvents**. Description of the purification process can be included in the field **Additional information for publication and purification details**. 

 
Finally, the user can <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Save</button> the reaction, <button className="button button--sm button--primary">Close</button> without saving, or <button className="button button--sm button--info">Export samples</button> as an xlsx file.
