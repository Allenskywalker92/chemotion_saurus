The  details modal or details window is opened by clicking on the desired element from element lists. It shows the information stored or available through databases about the element. The modal/window  can be set to full screen mode. Tabs were introduced to organize the information within the details modals. They enable information structuring and displaying as in folders. Different tabs are available based on the type of the element. This will become clear in the later chapters. 

## Details modal for samples 
![Details modal](/img/details_modal_samp.png)
Once you have entered and saved the structure of the sample, some additional information will be provided automatically. This applies to all information that can be generated by Open Babel based on the structure of your sample  (chemical formula, molecular weight). Likewise, the name of your molecule and its exact mass are created automatically, as far as the molecule is known via the PubChem database and this information is available, along with symbols of chemical safety. More details about chemical safety is provided as a link to PubChem too. 

### Properties tab
![Sample properties](/img/sample_properties.png)
The first tab that allows the description of samples is the **Properties** tab.  In the **Molecule** field, the user can pick the preferred naming convention for their molecule or write a new one. They could also specify the absolute and the relative configuration of the molecule in the fields **Stereo Abs**, **Stereo Rel** respectively from drop-downs. The user can mark their confidential data as **Top secret**.  

If you want to assign a name (e.g. a trivial name) to a sample, you can do this by making an entry in the **Name** or **Description** fields. Please note that the **Name** field for samples from reactions is overwritten by additional information. Your created sample will have the selected name, but when a new sample is created by dragging and dropping it into a reaction scheme, the Name field will be overwritten. If you want to save a second or more names for your sample permanently, use the **Description** field. 

:::danger Caution 
The **Name** field within the Sample **Properties** tab is overwritten for samples that represent products in  a reaction, because the product **Name** is required.  
::: 

In addition to the naming options, an external label can be saved for each sample. This external label should be used to enable your sample to be assigned to another storage system. For example, if you make a sample available for a reference database or send it to a cooperation partner who renames your sample, your sample will receive a sequential number that is not determined by you. Enter this number in the **External label** field. For participants in the [Compound Platform](https://www.complat.kit.edu/), the **External label** field is reserved for the X-Vial numbers of the samples. 

Solvent can be specified from a predefined drop-down. The amount can be provided either as mass or in mols, where providing one of them leads to automatic calculation of the other based on the purity (1 by default but can be modified). Mass unit can be either g or mg, while amount unit is either mol or mmol. Volume data can’t be edited until the density is specified.  When the density is specified (g/ml), the volume is automatically calculated. Changing the volume manually leads to automatic changes in the mass. 

Both** Boiling point** and **Melting point** can be provided manually in Celsius **°C**. The user can additionally provide any desired information as free text in the **Description** field and specify the location of the samples (e.g. institute, warehouse, etc.) in the **Location**  field. 

The **Elemental composition** is automatically calculated based on the formula, but the user can still provide their experimental numbers in fields that correspond to each atom in the molecule. 

The information required for chemical use is supplemented by **Chemical identifiers** such as **InChI** , **Canonical SMILLES** and **CAS** number. Molecular structure is also provided in the **Molfile** format.  You can provide the **Canonical SMILLES** to create a new **Sample**, but you can’t modify the SMILES after creation. The other identifiers can only be copied after a **Sample** is created, and they can’t be used to generate Samples.
