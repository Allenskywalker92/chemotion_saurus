The  details modal or details window is opened by clicking on the desired element from element lists. It shows the information stored or available through databases about the element. The modal/window  can be set to full screen mode. Its frame is identified by two colors: a dark blue and a light blue. The color light blue means that changes have been made within the modal, but they have not been saved yet. If this is the case, a small save symbol also appears in the modal bar <Btn icon={faSave} color={"warning"}/>. As soon as you have saved all the entered data, the frame color changes to dark blue and the symbol disappears.

Tabs were introduced to organize the information within the details modals. They enable information structuring and displaying as in folders. Different tabs are available based on the type of the element. This will become clear in the later chapters. 

## Details modal for samples 
![Details modal](/img/details_modal_samp.png)
Once you have entered and saved the structure of the sample, some additional information will be provided automatically. This applies to all information that can be generated by Open Babel based on the structure of your sample  (chemical formula, molecular weight). Likewise, the name of your molecule and its exact mass are created automatically, as far as the molecule is known via the PubChem database and this information is available, along with symbols of chemical safety. More details about chemical safety is provided as a link to PubChem too. 

### Properties tab
![Sample properties](/img/sample_properties.png)
The first tab that allows the description of samples is the **Properties** tab.  In the **Molecule** field, the user can pick the preferred naming convention for their molecule or write a new one. They could also specify the absolute and the relative configuration of the molecule in the fields **Stereo Abs**, **Stereo Rel** respectively from drop-downs. The user can mark their confidential data as **Top secret**.  

If you want to assign a name (e.g. a trivial name) to a sample, you can do this by making an entry in the **Name** or **Description** fields. Please note that the **Name** field for samples from reactions is overwritten by additional information. Your created sample will have the selected name, but when a new sample is created by dragging and dropping it into a reaction scheme, the Name field will be overwritten. If you want to save a second or more names for your sample permanently, use the **Description** field. 

:::danger Caution 
The **Name** field within the Sample **Properties** tab is overwritten for samples that represent products in  a reaction, because the product **Name** is required.  
::: 

In addition to the naming options, an external label can be saved for each sample. This external label should be used to enable your sample to be assigned to another storage system. For example, if you make a sample available for a reference database or send it to a cooperation partner who renames your sample, your sample will receive a sequential number that is not determined by you. Enter this number in the **External label** field. For participants in the [Compound Platform](https://www.complat.kit.edu/), the **External label** field is reserved for the X-Vial numbers of the samples. 

Solvent can be specified from a predefined drop-down. The amount can be provided either as mass or in mols, where providing one of them leads to automatic calculation of the other based on the purity (1 by default but can be modified). Mass unit can be either g or mg, while amount unit is either mol or mmol. Volume data can’t be edited until the density is specified.  When the density is specified (g/ml), the volume is automatically calculated. Changing the volume manually leads to automatic changes in the mass. 

Both** Boiling point** and **Melting point** can be provided manually in Celsius **°C**. The user can additionally provide any desired information as free text in the **Description** field and specify the location of the samples (e.g. institute, warehouse, etc.) in the **Location**  field. 

The **Elemental composition** is automatically calculated based on the formula, but the user can still provide their experimental numbers in fields that correspond to each atom in the molecule. 

The information required for chemical use is supplemented by **Chemical identifiers** such as **InChI** , **Canonical SMILLES** and **CAS** number. Molecular structure is also provided in the **Molfile** format.  You can provide the **Canonical SMILLES** to create a new **Sample**, but you can’t modify the SMILES after creation. The other identifiers can only be copied after a **Sample** is created, and they can’t be used to generate Samples. 

### Analyses tab 
![Analyses](/img/analyses_tab.gif)

To add analytics information to the ELN, the **Analyses** tab is available. Here the evaluation of the performed analytical experiments can be entered  (field **Content**) and additional files can be uploaded to store the data and its documents  (see  datasets).  

You can create as many analyses for a sample as you need with the button <button className={"button button--sm button--success"} style={{padding:"0.5rem"}}><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg"/> Add analysis</button>, and for each analysis you can upload as many datasets (files) as you want with the button <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/>. Please pay attention to the structure of the data storage and take care of the input fields, this will allow you to search your results quickly. Any information that you define through the created fields is available to the ELN for processing and this data can be displayed or summarized in lists.  

The uploaded records can be supplemented with information in an input modal available for each data file. The input modal opens either when you create a new data record, or when you click on the link generated by the name of existing data records. 

Analyses that you have entered are shown in short form e.g. in the sample list, and you can find out at a glance which data you have entered. The illustration shows the sample list with symbols such as <button className={"button button--sm button--secondary"} style={{padding:"0.5rem"}}><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faChartBar} size="lg"/> 1 ?</button> or <button className={"button button--sm button--secondary"} style={{padding:"0.5rem"}}><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faChartBar} size="lg"/> 1 <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCheck} size="sm"/></button>. The first case means that you have set an analysis for the analyzed sample, but its **Status** is so far **Unconfirmed**. The second symbol informs you again about an existing analysis whose **Status** has already been **Confirmed**, and therefore, it is classified by you as correct. The number given always refers to the number of analyses, not to the number of uploaded data files.

The analysis methods, from which you can choose, are given by the drop-down menu **Type (Chemical Methods Ontology)**. You shouldn't forget one important property of the ELN: the uploaded data files and entered information are not saved until you confirm that with <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Save</button> or <Btn icon={faSave} color={"warning"}/>. This point if overlooked can lead to the loss of the data you have set. 

### Literature tab 
![Literature](/img/literature_tab.gif)

The **Literature** tab allows you to manage your literature and link it to your **Sample**. You can specify as many references as you find needed. It is possible to specify the reference either by its DOI or ISBN, or by giving it a title and a URL. In both cases, you can add whether this reference is citing you or cited by you. When all details of a reference are entered, press <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/>. Once a reference is created, it cannot be edited, it can only be deleted, so if you need to edit a reference, delete it and create a new one.  

The created references are added to a list and they are shown in blue to indicate their functionality in linking to some resources by clicking on them. Each reference can by copied using <Btn icon={faPaste} color={"secondary"}/>, which will copy the information provided in the list. Additional details about the reference, as by whom it was created and whether it is referring to or cited by you,  can be shown by pressing the button <Btn icon={faAngleRight} color={"secondary"}/>, which also shows the delete button <Btn icon={faTrashAlt} color={"danger"}/>. Don’t forget to save your changes with <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Save</button>. 

### SciFinder tab 
Not available at the moment.

### Results tab 
This tab is not supported at the moment as it is still being developed.

### QC & curation tab 

## Details modal for reactions 
### Scheme tab 
The **Scheme** tab initially contains the scheme of the selected reaction. While the molecular structure of samples can be edited by selecting the structure field and opening the **Ketcher** editor, the reaction **Scheme** cannot be changed. If the user wants to change their reaction, they have to select the contained samples and change their structure or select other samples. 

:::info  
Changing a reaction is not possible by changing its scheme, rather it must be carried out indirectly by selecting or changing the samples.
