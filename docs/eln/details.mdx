The  detail modal or detail window is opened by clicking on the desired element from element lists. It shows the information stored or available through databases about the element. The modal/window  can be set to full screen mode. Tabs were introduced to organize the information within the detail modals.  They enable information structuring and displaying as in folders. Different tabs are available based on the type of the element. This will become clear in the later chapters.
