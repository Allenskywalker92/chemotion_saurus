The  detail modal or detail window is opened by clicking on the desired element from element lists. It shows the information stored or available through databases about the element. The modal/window  can be set to full screen mode. Tabs were introduced to organize the information within the detail modals.  They enable information structuring and displaying as in folders. Different tabs are available based on the type of the element. This will become clear in the later chapters. 

## Detail modal for samples 
Once you have entered and saved the structure of the sample, some additional information will be provided automatically. This applies to all information that can be generated by Open Babel based on the structure of your sample  (chemical formula, molecular weight). Likewise, the name of your molecule and its exact mass are created automatically, as far as the molecule is known via the PubChem database and this information is available, along with symbols of chemical safety. More details about chemical safety is provided as a link to PubChem too. 

`Properties`: The first tab that allows the description of samples is the **Properties** tab.  In the **Molecule** field, the user can pick the preferred naming convention for their molecule or write a new one. They could also specify the absolute and the relative configuration of the molecule in the fields **Stereo Abs**, **Stereo Rel**  respectively. The user can mark their confidential data as **Top secret**.
