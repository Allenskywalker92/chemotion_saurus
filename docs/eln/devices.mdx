## General concept
The principles for device integration are described in: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acax.2019.100007  
Several descriptions and images are derived from the above mentioned manuscript published in Analytica Chimica Acta X and the assigned supplemental information. 

Referring to the diverse origin of data in chemistry labs, we implemented three different procedures to allow the availability of data to the ELN server (Figure 1). The first procedure includes the transfer of data (preferably small data) by a mailing system which manages the capture of NMR data and additional information that is sent by mail to the email account of the ELN. A second procedure was designed for the transfer of data from a local server or computer with network connection to the ELN server. The last procedure was implemented for the transfer of data from devices without network access (due to safety standards, location issues or software-related issues). For the transfer of data from devices without network connectivity, we implemented a procedure which requires the manual collection of data (for example with a portable data storage e.g. an USB flash drive) and its transfer to the ELN via WinSCP running on a computer with network connection.

**Figure 1:** Overview of the three procedures to integrate research data from (analytical) devices to an ELN. The given ana-lytical methods are chosen as examples to illustrate the procedure. They can be exchanged depending on the local infrastructure.

General requirements concern in general the device and ELN specific adaptations, therefore, the following documentation contains always aspects of ELN setting adaptation and device specific settings. 
The ELN specific adjustments depend on the use of a mail-collector (used to collect data transferred by email to a mail-server) or a datacollector (used to collect data transferred to a server)  as a basic process for the desired data transfer. 

### Mail-Collector 
One of the easiest possibilities to transfer data to a management systemsuch as the Chemotion-ELN is to send data per email. The software of some analytical devices support the mailing of measurements to a user defined email address by default. This allows to implement storage routines that are independent of any additional software or hardware on the instrument’s side. The only prerequisite for a use of the MailCollector routine is fulfilled if one can set the email to be send to two addresses, to the ELN server associated email ad-dress and to the user’s email address registered with the corresponding ELN account (Figure 2). This is necessary to identify the target of the mailed information and the corresponding account in the ELN. In short, four configuration steps are necessary to fetch the information via email: 
•	First, it is necessary to have an email account for the ELN with any provider or server that supports Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to centrally collect the emailed data.
•	Second, the device software has to be configured to send the data to the user’s (scientist’s) email account as a main recipient and to this ELN email address as a main recipient or in cc. 
•	Third, the devices sending emails should be whitelisted by the ELN server. For this, the devices information is persisted in the ELN DB as ‘device’ entities. The device class is a subclass of the ELN User class and each device’s email can then be registered (step 3, Figure 2).
•	The last step for the implementation of the mailing routine is the activation of the MailCollector service with-in the Chemotion ELN (this is also done by the administrator of the ELN server). For this, the credentials (email address and password) and email server IMAP settings for the ELN mail account as well as the cron time schedule parameters are configured (step 4, Figure 2). 
The MailCollector (see Figure 2 for the used routine) screens the ELN account for new emails and processes the data subsequently. The processing follows the routine: inspect – store– delete. New emails are inspected with respect to the sender (device) and the recipient (user). If both are known to the MailCollector, the service adds the data in the email’s attachment to the ELN server and deletes the mail from the inbox of the ELN email account. The MailCollector can be used e.g. for the transfer of NMR data from Burker instruments.

Additionally, the mailing procedure is very helpful if the information to be added to an ELN is captured with a mobile device or is available on a computer. In this manner, almost all data, independent of its origin, can be transferred to the ELN. The only step necessary for this procedure is sending an email (using the same email address the user is registered with in the ELN) to the ELN’s email account. Data that is attached to the email will be processed accord-ing to the MailCollector as described above and will be assigned to the user ELN account according to the email address of the sender (Figure 2).
