## Generic Segments and Elements

Generic elements and segments are structured according to the different levels **layer** and **field**. Each generic element or segment can contain different, multiple **layers** and each layer can consist of multiple and differnt **fields**.

## Fields

**Fields** are a wide variety of components with input, display, drag-and-drop functions, depends on the type. Use an appropriate type attribute to take advantage of these UI controls like formula field, system-defined, and more.

###  Field types 

| type | availability | dependencies | explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| checkbox | v0.9.0+ |---| a checkbox is shown as a small square box to let user to make a binary choice |
| drag molecule | v0.9.0+ |---| an icon with drag-and-drop function to let user to add a molecule into a generic element/segment by drag-and-drop operation; it will display the molecule image after adding successfully |
| drag sample | v0.9.0+ (generic element only) |---| an icon with drag-and-drop function to let user to add a sample into a generic element by drag-and-drop operation; it will display the sample image after adding successfully |
| formula field | v0.9.0+ |---| a calculation field; define the formula and system do the calculation automatically |
| input group | v0.9.0+ |---| a group of fields; the fields can be 'label', 'text', or 'integer', which 'label' is used for display only, 'text' and 'integer' are used as an input field|
| integer | v0.9.0+ |---| an input field for number entries |
| select | v0.9.0+ |---| a dropdown list to let user to select |
| system-defined | v0.9.0+ |---| an interconvertible unit field; with a numerical input field and a button for unit conversion ([details](#field-type-system-defined)) |
| text | v0.9.0+ |---| an input field to let user to enter a single editable line of text |
| text area | v0.9.0+ |---| an input field with adaptable size to let user to enter multi-line text |
| text formula | v0.9.0+ |---| a combine(display only) field to let user to combine other fields or necessary descriptions together |

###  Field-Type: System-defined 

The field type **System-defined** allows to add values with a unit. Units are assigned to certain standards in the community of the research field but should meet common conventions and definitions. Depending on the unit that is used, different conversions are available.
