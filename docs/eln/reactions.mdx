## Meaning  

The element reactions can be used to summarize all actions that involve several substances, materials or chemicals.  Samples are always an essential part of reactions. In general, the more carefully the ELN user documents the use of samples and differentiates between the individual actions (e.g. use of split and copy), the easier it is to document reactions and analyze the individual influences on a successful reaction. 

## Naming  

Reactions are numbered consecutively and displayed in the list of reactions in reverse order according to their number. The reaction name is preceded by the abbreviation of the ELN owner so that reactions can be clearly identified. If you want to assign another name to the reaction, you can do this by making an entry in the **Name** field within the **Scheme** tab or **Properties** tab.
