## Meaning  

The element reactions can be used to summarize all actions that involve several substances, materials or chemicals.  Samples are always an essential part of reactions. In general, the more carefully the ELN user documents the use of samples and differentiates between the individual actions (e.g. use of split and copy), the easier it is to document reactions and analyze the individual influences on a successful reaction. 

## Naming  

Reactions are numbered consecutively and displayed in the list of reactions in reverse order according to their number. The reaction name is preceded by the abbreviation of the ELN owner so that reactions can be clearly identified. If you want to assign another name to the reaction, you can do this by making an entry in the **Name** field within the **Scheme** tab or **Properties** tab. 

## Generation 

Reactions can be generated from the action bar by pressing <Btn mixed={[faSortDown]} color={"primary"}/> and choosing **Create Reaction**. If the user is already in the reaction tab from the element bar, the action button for adding is already set up accordingly to adding reactions. It looks like this <img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/add_reaction.png"} width={"30px"} alt={"Add reaction"}/>, and you can make the selection directly. 

Once a reaction is generated, its details modal pops up, and then the user can fill the reaction with the interacting samples and the resulting products from within the **Scheme** tab. More details about populating a reaction with samples can be found in the [Details modal for reactions](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/details_modal#details-modal-for-reactions) chapter. 

:::danger Caution 
To balance your equation, changing coefficients is still not possible, so you need multiple samples to express a single molecule when it has a coefficient more than one. This step is important for correct calculations of the yield.
