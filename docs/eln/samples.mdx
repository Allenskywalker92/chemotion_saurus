## Meaning 

Samples are the smallest organizational unit of this ELN. They describe the physical unit of a chemical compound used for a synthesis or other projects. The sample is described by e.g. the molecular structure, the amount and properties of the compound used (such as the purity). If a chemical compound with the same molecular structure is used several times, several samples are generated, each with the same molecular structure as a feature. The samples and their molecular structures are summarized in the samples list accessed from the element bar (Find the element bar in the structure of the [Main Page](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/structure#main-page)). The details of the stored information and the information additionally queried in databases are displayed in the [details modal of the samples](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/details_modal#details-modal-for-samples).    

Samples are required for almost every operation within the ELN, and their maintenance and thoughtful use is key to using the ELN successfully. 

## Numbering and naming 

Samples are numbered consecutively and displayed in the list of samples according to their last use (this differs from the display of reactions!). The sample number is preceded by the abbreviation of the ELN owner so that samples can be clearly identified. If you want to assign a name (e.g. a trivial name) to a sample, you can do this by making an entry in the Name or Description field within the [Properties tab](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/details_modal#properties-tab). Please note that the Name field for samples from reactions is overwritten by additional information. Your created sample will have the selected name, but when a new sample is created by dragging and dropping it into a [reaction scheme](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/details_modal#scheme-tab), the Name field will be overwritten. If you want to save a second or more names for your sample permanently, use the **Description** field.  

:::danger Caution  
The **Name** field within the Sample **Properties** tab is overwritten for samples that represent products in a reaction because it is required to generate a product name. 
::: 

In addition to the naming options, an external label can be saved for each sample. This external label should be used to enable your sample to be assigned to another storage system. For example, if you make a sample available for a reference database or send it to a cooperation partner who renames your sample, your sample will receive a sequential number that is not determined by you. Enter this number in the **External label** field. For participants in the [Compound Platform](https://www.complat.kit.edu/), the **External label** field is reserved for the X-Vial numbers of the samples. 

:::caution Recommendation 
If you provide samples, references, or screening material via the Compound Platform, please use the **External label** field to enter the X-Vial number. 
Please enter the X before the serial number.

## Samples in the element bar 

<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/samples_list.png"}  alt={"Samples List"}/> 

In the element bar, samples are listed first as the most important common unit of this ELN. The tab of the samples has the benzene ring <img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/benzen.png"} width={"30px"} alt={"Benzene"}/>  as a symbol. The user will notice the number next to the sample symbol and the number in parentheses. The number right next to the sample symbol indicates the number of samples within the selected collection. The number in parentheses shows the number of selected samples within the collection. The element bar shown in Figure 1 appears when the ELN is opened if no detail level has been selected. When selecting the level of detail by selecting a sample, the element bar is reduced and the [details modal](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/details_modal#details-modal-for-samples) appears. 

The element bar provides an overview of a lot of information. It should be noted that the areas with a gray background within the sample list represent the molecules whose structures are used by samples. These fields do not represent certain samples with properties, but only the general chemical structure. All associated samples of the same structure are then listed below the structure in the white fileds. If the user does not want to see the samples for a molecular structure, they can hide them with <Btn mixed={[faChevronDown]}/>. Both molecules and samples can be copied using the drag & drop function. This functionality is available through the symbol <Btn mixed={[faArrowsAlt]}/>. A cross with a white background transfers the sample (this corresponds to the **Split sample** action), a cross with a gray background transfers the molecule (i.e. only the information of the structure is transferred, this corresponds to the **Copy sample** action). Further symbols in the samples list provide information about whether the corresponding sample appears in a reaction equation (reaction tab) <img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/reaction.svg"} width={"30px"} alt={"Reaction"}/>, and whether and how often the sample was shared with other people or groups <Btn mixed={[faList, " 1"]}/>. The molecular structure is accompanied by symbols within the samples list, which provide information about the availability of the structure of the sample in the SciFinder database. A colored symbol <img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/scifinder_symbol.svg"} width={"30px"} alt={"SciFinder Stmbol"}/> indicates that the structure is known in SciFinder. A crossed-out gray symbol indicates that the structure was not part of the database at the time of the query.
