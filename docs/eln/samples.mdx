## Meaning 

Samples are the smallest organizational unit of this ELN. They describe the physical unit of a chemical compound used for a synthesis or other projects. The sample is described by e.g. the molecular structure, the amount and properties of the compound used (such as the purity). If a chemical compound with the same molecular structure is used several times, several samples are generated, each with the same molecular structure as a feature. The samples and their molecular structures are summarized in the samples list accessed from the element bar (Find the element bar in the structure of the [Main Page](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/structure#main-page)). The details of the stored information and the information additionally queried in databases are displayed in the [details modal of the samples](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/details_modal#details-modal-for-samples).    

Samples are required for almost every operation within the ELN, and their maintenance and thoughtful use is key to using the ELN successfully. 

## Numbering and naming 

Samples are numbered consecutively and displayed in the list of samples according to their last use (this differs from the display of reactions!). The sample number is preceded by the abbreviation of the ELN owner so that samples can be clearly identified. If you want to assign a name (e.g. a trivial name) to a sample, you can do this by making an entry in the Name or Description field within the [Properties tab](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/details_modal#properties-tab). Please note that the Name field for samples from reactions is overwritten by additional information. Your created sample will have the selected name, but when a new sample is created by dragging and dropping it into a [reaction scheme](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/details_modal#scheme-tab), the Name field will be overwritten. If you want to save a second or more names for your sample permanently, use the **Description** field.  

:::danger Caution  
The **Name** field within the Sample **Properties** tab is overwritten for samples that represent products in a reaction because it is required to generate a product name.
