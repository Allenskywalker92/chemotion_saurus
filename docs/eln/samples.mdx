## Meaning: 
Samples are the smallest organizational unit of this ELN. They describe the physical unit of a chemical compound used for a synthesis or other projects. The sample is described by e.g. the molecular structure, the amount and properties of the compound used (such as the purity). If a chemical compound with the same molecular structure is used several times, several samples are generated, each with the same molecular structure as a feature. The samples and their molecular structures are summarized in the samples list access from the element bar (Find the element bar in the structure of the [Main Page](./eln/structure#main-page)), the details of the stored information and the information additionally queried in databases are displayed in the [details modal of the samples.](./eln/details_modal#details-modal-for-samples).  

Samples are required for almost every operation within the ELN, and their maintenance and thoughtful use is key to using the ELN successfully.
