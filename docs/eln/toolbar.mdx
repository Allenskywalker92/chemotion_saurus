The toolbar provides a variety of functions to control the ELN elements. Those functions include adding, copying, deleting, moving, filtering, importing and exporting.

## Filtering

The user can filter a selected collection or even the **All** collection with the filtering bar <img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/filter.png"} width={"20"} alt={"Filter bar"}/>. The user can search the entire collection or selected elements of it by clicking on <Btn mixed={["All", faSortDown]} color={"secondary"}/> and choosing the desired element (**Samples**, **Reactions**, **Wellplates**, **Screens**) from the menu to appear, where the <Btn mixed={["All", faSortDown]} color={"secondary"}/> is replaced by the corresponding symbol of the element. The menu also shows the option of **Advanced Search**, which will be clarified later on in this chapter. 

Possible search terms are **IUPAC** names, **InChI**, **SMILES**, **RInChI**. The user can also use the element **Name** or **Short Label**. Enter the search term and press "Enter", which shows a list of filtered results. While the user is typing their search term, a menu of suggestions appear, and it keeps getting updated throughout typing.  Another option will be to use Ketcher editor, which opens when pressing <Btn mixed={[faPen]} color={"primary"}/>, and to draw a structure to perform **Similarity Search** or **Substructure Search** and to decide the degree of similarity too. When the structure is ready to be used, the user can choose <Btn mixed={["Search"]} color={"primary"}/> or simply <Btn mixed={["Cancel"]} color={"warning"}/>. To cancel the search process or delete the current search term, press <Btn mixed={[faTimes]} color={"danger"}/> 

<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/advance_search.png"}  alt={"Advancd search"}/> 

In the **Advanced Search**, the user can **Select search type** which opens a menu to pick from looking up the **EXACT** term, or entering a substring to look up for, and here the substring can either be included for the search (**LIKE (case insensitive substring)**) or excluded (**NOT LIKE (case insensitive substring)**). In both cases, more strict case sensitive search can be done with **LIKE (substring)** and **NOT LIKE (substring)**. Another menu enables the user to choose the term type. Available options are **Sample Name**, **Sample Short Label**, **Sample External Label**, and **CAS**. Finally, there is the field for the **Search value**. When the user enters all the entries, they should choose <Btn mixed={["Search"]} color={"primary"}/>. If they want to cancel the search, they could choose <Btn mixed={["Close"]} color={"warning"}/>. 

:::danger Caution 
Although the **Advanced Search** states **Sample** in its menus, e.g. **Sample Name**, it could actually be apply to other elements too.

## Import Data to the ELN
### Import samples to a certain ELN-collection

Samples can be imported easily using an excel template that contains Smiles-Strings. To enable the import into a collection, the desired target collection has to be selected. 
Please see the following example which can be used as a template to import data to the ELN. The template file can be used as test file to check the functions of the ELN, for a specific import, please delete the current content.

<p><DownloadBtn text={"Download XLSX Template here "} files={['/chemotionsaurus/files/template%20_sample_import.xlsx']}/><br></br>Please don't change the header of the template file. </p>

Information on the columns and requirements: 
The columns "stereo_abs" and "stereo_rel" are predefined. Valid values are: 
stereo_abs: any, rac, meso, (S), (R), (Sp), (Rp), (Sa); 
stereo_rel: any, syn, anti, p-geminal, p-ortho, p-meta, p-para, cis, trans, fac

After downloading the XLSX Template you can import it in your ELN as shown below:

:::caution Recommendation
Please add either molfile or Smiles-Code to the import template. The import process will fail if both is entered.

## Export Data from the ELN

The export of data can be done in different ways, all functions are embedded to the main toolbar.
