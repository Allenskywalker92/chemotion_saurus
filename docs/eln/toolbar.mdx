The toolbar (or action bar) provides a variety of functions to control the ELN elements. Those functions include adding, copying, deleting, moving, filtering, importing and exporting.

## Filtering

The user can filter a selected collection or even the **All** collection with the filtering bar. <img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/filter.png"} alt={"Filter bar"}/>. 

The user can search the entire collection or selected elements of it by clicking on <Btn mixed={["All", faSortDown]} color={"secondary"}/> and choosing the desired element ( **Samples** , **Reactions** , **Wellplates** , **Screens**) from the menu to appear, where the <Btn mixed={["All", faSortDown]} color={"secondary"}/> is replaced by the corresponding symbol of the element. The menu also shows the option of **Advanced Search**, which will be clarified later on in this chapter. 

Possible search terms are **IUPAC** names, **InChI**, **SMILES**, **RInChI**. The user can also use the element **Name** or **Short Label**. Enter the search term and press "Enter", which shows a list of filtered results. While the user is typing their search term, a menu of suggestions appear, and it keeps getting updated throughout typing.  Another option will be to use Ketcher editor, which opens when pressing <Btn mixed={[faPen]} color={"primary"}/>, and to draw a structure to perform **Similarity Search** or **Substructure Search**, and to decide the degree of similarity too. When the structure is ready to be used, the user can choose <Btn mixed={["Search"]} color={"primary"}/> or simply <Btn mixed={["Cancel"]} color={"warning"}/>. To cancel the search process or delete the current search term, press <Btn mixed={[faTimes]} color={"danger"}/> 

<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/advance_search.png"}  alt={"Advancd search"}/> 

In the **Advanced Search**, the user can **Select search type** which opens a menu to pick from looking up the **EXACT** term, or entering a substring to look up for, and here the substring can either be included for the search (**LIKE (case insensitive substring)**) or excluded (**NOT LIKE (case insensitive substring)**). In both cases, more strict case sensitive search can be done with **LIKE (substring)** and **NOT LIKE (substring)**. Another menu enables the user to choose the term type. Available options are **Sample Name**, **Sample Short Label**, **Sample External Label**, and **CAS**. Finally, there is the field for the **Search value**. When the user enters all the entries, they should choose <Btn mixed={["Search"]} color={"primary"}/>. If they want to cancel the search, they could choose <Btn mixed={["Close"]} color={"warning"}/>. 

:::danger Caution 
Although the **Advanced Search** states **Sample** in its menus, e.g. **Sample Name**, it could actually be applied to other elements too.

## Organizing elements in collections 

### Add elements from one collection to another 

Elements from one collection can be added to another one by means of moving or assigning. The elements added to the target collection have the same properties of the original ones. If some elements already exist in the target collection with the same short label of added elements, only the added elements are kept, i.e. the properties of already existing elements will be updated based on the added ones. 

The abovementioned action could be done by selecting the chosen elements, and pressing <Btn mixed={[faArrowRight, faSortDown]} color={"success"}/>. A menu  opens with two options: **Move to Collection** and **Assign to Collection**. Both options will open the following window to **Select a Collection** as a target from a drop-down menu, **or Create a new Collection** by inserting its name in the corresponding field.  When the user is done, they are to press <Btn mixed={["Submit"]} color={"warning"}/>.  

<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/move_to_collection.png"} alt={"Move to Collection"}/> 

Please note that if the user chooses to **Assign to Collection**, the title of the window will be **Assign to Collection**. 

`Move to Collection`: This action results in moving the selected elements from the selected collection to the target one, this means that the moved elements will no longer appear in the original collection. 

`Assign to Collection`: This action results in creating a copy of the selected elements in the target collection, this means that the assigned elements will be present in both collections. 

### Remove elements from a collection 

This action can be performed by pressing <Btn mixed={[faMinusSquare]} color={"warning"}/>. A menu  opens with two options: **Remove from current Collection** and **Remove from all Collections**. When the user removes samples that are associated with other elements such as reactions, the other elements still stand, but the deleted samples will not be accessible, e.g. from within a reaction, anymore, and there will be no way to edit them. 

`Remove from current Collection`: This action removes the selected elements only from the selected collection, but a copy is kept in the back up collection **All**. The user is asked to confirm their decision via a pop-up window by pressing <Btn mixed={["Remove"]} color={"warning"}/>, or otherwise to press <Btn mixed={["Cancel"]} color={"primary"}/>. 

`Remove from all Collections`: This action removes all the copies there are of the selected elements. The user is asked to confirm their decision via a pop-up window by pressing <Btn mixed={["Delete"]} color={"warning"}/>, or otherwise to press <Btn mixed={["Cancel"]} color={"primary"}/>. An option is provided in case the user is trying to remove reactions, which is to choose whether to delete the samples associated with the reactions, if the user chooses not to, then only the reactants and solvents associated with the deleted reaction are deleted too. 

## Sharing collections 

![Collection Sharing](/img/collection_sharing.gif)  

Shared collections are collections that can be created by users if they want to share their data with a specific person or a group, so **Sharing** will make the data available to that person or group.  

Collections shared by the user appear as **My project with** owner/recipient in **My shared Collections** in the collections bar and can be sorted through collection management. An ELN user who receives information in the form of a shared collection from another ELN user cannot sort that shared collection.  

An important feature of the shared collections that the user, whether a creator or a recipient of the shared collection, must be aware of: Changes to the shared collection can only be made to existing elements. When new elements are added within the original collection, this is not reflected in the shared collection. Only changes within existing elements are transferred to the shared collection. This is a significant difference from the synchronized collections.  

:::info  
In a shared collection, only changes to existing elements are displayed to users. Elements added after sharing to the original collection will not be considered. 
::: 

To share a collection, press <Btn mixed={[faShareAlt]} color={"info"}/>, this will open the following window. 

<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/sharing.png"} alt={"Sharing"}/> 

Collections that an ELN user has obtained as shared collections from another user are subject to a rights system, which is always defined by the original owner. According to these system, the recipient of the shared collection can perform certain actions on it. The original owner can optionally set a **Role** to the recipient. Each role corresponds to a default **Permission level**, and means that **Everything** is being shared when it comes to the detail level for samples, reactions, wellplates, and screens. The original owner can still change those **Permission level**s and detail levels, but in this case the **Role** already set will be removed. The following table shows the possible **Role**s with the corresponding **Permission level**s.

| Role | Permission level | 

|---|---| 

| User | Delete | 

| Partner | Write | 

| Collaborator |Read | 

| Reviewer | Read | 

| Supervisor | Import Elements | 


## Import Data to the ELN
### Import samples to a certain ELN-collection

Samples can be imported easily using an excel template that contains Smiles-Strings. To enable the import into a collection, the desired target collection has to be selected. 
Please see the following example which can be used as a template to import data to the ELN. The template file can be used as test file to check the functions of the ELN, for a specific import, please delete the current content.

<p><DownloadBtn text={"Download XLSX Template here "} files={['/chemotionsaurus/files/template%20_sample_import.xlsx']}/><br></br>Please don't change the header of the template file. </p>

Information on the columns and requirements: 
The columns "stereo_abs" and "stereo_rel" are predefined. Valid values are: 
stereo_abs: any, rac, meso, (S), (R), (Sp), (Rp), (Sa); 
stereo_rel: any, syn, anti, p-geminal, p-ortho, p-meta, p-para, cis, trans, fac

After downloading the XLSX Template you can import it in your ELN as shown below:
![Collection View](/img/import_samples_short.gif)

:::caution Recommendation
Please add either molfile or Smiles-Code to the import template. The import process will fail if both is entered.

## Export Data from the ELN

The export of data can be done in different ways, all functions are embedded to the main toolbar.
