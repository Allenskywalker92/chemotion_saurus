## Access and Collections

#### How to share elements from Chemotion ELN with others? Especially to limit the access of trainees, for role assignment and access rights?

- **Answer:** Everyone is the owner of their account. Accounts are not shared and can't be controlled by, e.g., a supervisor, but they can be deleted by Chemotion admins. However, sharing of certain elements of the ELN, and assigning roles is still possible through collections sharing and synchronizing. For more details on those two functions, please refer to [Shared collections](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/collections#shared-collections) and [Synchronized collections](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/collections#synchronized-collections)

#### Is it possible to use Chemotion ELN offline?

- **Answer:** Chemotion ELN is a web based application that can only be used through internet connection. PLease make sure to use Chrome browser.

#### Is there a standalone version from Chemotion ELN? 

- **Answer:** Currently there is no standalone version from Chemotion ELN, and there are no plans to have it in the near future.

#### What are the prerequisites for proper Chemotion ELN  use?

- **Answer:** Standard laptop/pc is sufficient, internet connection and Chrome browser. PLease be careful not to use other browsers as they seem to function, but this functionality is never complete.

#### How many people can work on a shared or synchronized collection at the same time?

- **Answer:** Any number of users in the real world can work simultaneously on a shared or synchronized collection.

## Restoring and Tracking
#### Are images of the ELN created, e.g., to retrieve data in case of accidental deletion of a collection?
- **Answer:** Only the current state of the data is saved in the database, but images of data and database are backed up (according to a backup plan). Most of the entries are soft deleted (marked as deleted in the database but are not removed). However, there is no user interface yet to easily restore them. Please pay attention that deleting a collection does not remove its elements, it rather removes the association between them and the collection. Elements can still be picked out individually  from **All** collection to a new collection. 

#### How is the ELN documenting the changes in data (e.g., time, author)? Is there a versioning/ time stamp? Any auditing capabilities?
- **Answer:** work-in-progress on versioning and auditing.

## Integrated Devices

#### Can I copy the data directly into Chemotion from another server (MS and NMR)?
- **Answer:** Yes. Please refer to [Devices overview](https://eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/devices).
