title: Structure of the ELN
slug: structure
---
The ELN consists of different panels that are combined in the application page: (1) The action bar on top of the page, (2) a navigation bar for the management of collections, (3) a summary of elements in list format and (4) the details panel which is accessible by selection of one of the elements in the list panel.

| |Bars |
|---|---|
|![action bar](/img/Aktionsleiste.png) | `Action Bar`: The action bar contains symbols for essential actions that are either very important for setting up the ELN or for using it. The action bar is located just below the browser window.|
|![collection bar](/img/collection_bar.png) | `Collection Bar`: The collection bar is located on the left below the action bar. It can be toggled on/off.  |
|![Management-Ebene](/img/Management-Ebene.png) | `Management Level`: The management level can be opened using the button <img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/mgmt_level_btn.png"} width={"20px"} alt={"Management Level Button"}/> in the collection bar. The management level enables the creation, deletion and organization of collections. |
| ![element abr](/img/element_bar.png)  |`Element Bar`: The element bar is to the right of the collection bar. It shows the elements ** Sample **, ** Reaction **, ** Wellplate **,  ** Screen ** and **Research Plan** assigned to the selected collection. |

`Element`: The components of the ELN are described by elements. These are:  **Sample**, **Reaction**, **Wellplate**, **Screen** and **Research Plan**.

`Detail Modal`: The detail modal or detail window is opened by clicking on the desired element. It shows the information, which are stored on the corresponding element or are available through databases. The modal / window can be set to full screen mode.

`Detail Tab`: To organize the information within the detail modals tabs were introduced. These enable the information to be structured and are displayed as folders.

`The Elements`:
- `Samples`:
Samples are the smallest organizational unit of this ELN. They describe the physical unit of a chemical compound used for a synthesis or other projects. The sample is described by e.g. the molecular structure, the amount and properties of the compound used (such as the purity). If a chemical compound with the same molecular structure is used several times, several samples are generated, each with the same molecular structure as a feature.
- `Reactions`: Reactions form the core of the ELN, as reactions can be used to plan the chemists' experiments. The reactions are characterized by the use (starting material, reagents) and the receipt of samples (products).
- `Wellplates`: Several samples can be arranged in wellplates so that they can be combined according to an application in biology.
- `Screens`: A screen is the overview of a biological experiment that is carried out with several samples (usually organized by wellplates).
- `Research Plan`: A research plan is a generic element that can be used in a flexible manner to describe in particular processes. The reserach plan combines functions for text, tables, images and other information and allows the assignement of other elements such as molecules and reactions.  
- Others: the ELN in its first pure chemistry version included only the Elements as decribed above. In the meantime, a more flexible use of the ELN allows the definition of additional elements which can be defined and added to the ELN by the admin of each instance.

`Actions`:
-  `Split`: ** Split ** is an action that can be carried out according to the physical division of a sample into subsets (a certain amount of a chemical compound). A ** split ** represents the removal of a subset from a sample and depicts this by generating a new sample with the same properties as the original sample. The split action can be traced by numbering the newly created sample based on the original sample.
-  `Copy`: In contrast to the ** Split **, the ** Copy ** action means that a copy of only the molecular structure (including the parameters dependent on the molecular structure such as molecular weight) is made. The copy has no relation to the original sample and can be saved under a new name.
