`The registration`
Registration is a necessary step towards your own laboratory notebook. Please register on your first visit to the electronic laboratory notebook. Then use this access data for each subsequent login. The registration page or the login page will always be the first page accessed. 

`SciFinder`
The SciFinder function is currently only available at the ELN instance at KIT in Karlsruhe. A rework of the API to meet the requirement of SciFinderN will be provided as soon as possible

`Your first collection`
A collection is a collection of elements (molecules, reactions, screens, well plates) that is assigned to a theme or an application.
The functions of the collections and their structure will be explained in detail later. For a quick start of the ELN and for a first test, it is important to create the first own collectionin addition to the default collections All (backup collection) and chemotion.net (chemotion repository connection). 
New collections are generated in the collection management, accessible via the collection button [ ] in the collection bar. Please create a new entry **new collection** under **My collections** by pressing [ ]. 
Give your collection a name and save it by pressing update [ ].

:::danger Caution
Without the creation of a collection, the use of the ELN is not possible!
Think about a sensible structure and create a collection!
