The main way to enter chemical structures into the ELN is the Ketcher Editor. The editor is available via the sample detail modal and can be opened by clicking on the area framed in light blue. The Ketcher Editor is not a product of the Chemotion programming group, but it has been modified so that it can be used flexibly for a wide variety of applications. After the additions made, the structure editor integrated within the ELN is now unique in its functionality and, in addition to the input of small chemical molecules, it also enables the mapping of polymeric carrier materials (beads). The editor will also be supplemented by further developments in the future. 

## Basic functions 

The Ketcher structure editor offers all the basic functions that are necessary for chemical work and the input of structures. Drawn molecules can be rotated, optimized, copied and pasted again. The size of the displayed molecules can be changed by adjusting the zoom factor. 

In the left side of the image above, some functions have a small balck arrow in the lower right corner. This arrow indicates the possibility to change to other similar function e.g. single bond to double bond. This will become clear later in this page.
